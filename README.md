# Ecommerce_data
sqlite/python project to better understand sql and python scripting

plan is to essentially utilize this project to learn how to implement CRUD on a large data set. 

utilizing a [CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidramazam/e-commerce-sales-performance-analysis) from [kaggle](kaggle.com/divetrainer)

will utilize cli tools to perform sqlite functions and also read up on how they factor into ADF pipelines for more understanding of an enterprise approach

goal is to touch* this project twice a week to make sure I am adding/removing/creating relational db that showcase meaningful data from the data set chosen

general goals

[] create a table with data showcasing sales performance metrics by item sold
[] python script to pull data and manipulate it outside of sqlite3
